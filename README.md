# B.Tech Project : A Hybrid Movie Recommendation Engine

## Introduction

The project objective is to build a hybrid recommendation engine by mixing recommendations from content-based filtering and collaborative filtering.

## Problem 

Recommendation systems have become an integral part of many businesses. They produce individualized recommendations as output or have the effect of guiding the user in a personalized way to interesting objects in a larger space of possible options.

In this project, we want to apply machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models and hence build a hybrid movie recommendation system that suggests the most suitable movies for users based on their preferences.

## Data

This project uses the MovieLens dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

It contain metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts and vote averages.

This dataset also has files containing 26 million ratings from 270,000 users for all 45,000 movies. Ratings are on a scale of 1-5 and have been obtained from the official GroupLens website.
